# Return Ready Lab 14

* Part A - Foundations 6.2
* Part B - Foundations Practice

## Part A

### Exercise 01

#### Step 01

In the package `partA.ex01` look at the file `SquareRootWhile`.

#### Step 02

In the package `partA.ex01` modify `SquareRootWhile` per the following:

        Use a while loop to repeatedly prompt users to type a number until they type a non negative number. 
        If they type a non negative number, then compute the square root.

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
Type a non-negative integer: -5
Invalid number, try again: -1
Invalid number, try again: 11
The square root of 11 is 3.166
```

### Exercise 02

#### Step 01

In the package `partA.ex02` look at the file `SumOfNums`.

#### Step 02

In the package `partA.ex02` observe `SumOfNums` which sums up a
sequence of 10 integers that are input by the user.

* Can you implement the same by using a do-while loop?
* If the answer is yes, try it out!


## Part B

### Exercise 01

#### Step 01

In the package `partB.ex01` look at the file `DoWhileLoopDemoExample` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `partB.ex01` complete the `DoWhileLoop` per the following:

    Create a program that has an array of integers with five unique values
    Utilize a do/while loop to print out each of the unique elements of the array

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
43
55
68
91
105
```

### Exercise 02

#### Step 01

In the package `partB.ex02` look at the file `WhileLoopDemoExample` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `partB.ex02` complete the `WhileLoop` per the following:

    Create a program that loops through numbers - beginning at 1 and up to 1,000
    As the program loops through each number, it should print out all of the even values
    Be sure to use a while loop to perform the loop and printing
    HINT: Remember to use a certain operator to perform the logical check for whether or not the number is even

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
2 is even
4 is even
6 is even
8 is even
10 is even
...
...
...
992 is even
994 is even
996 is even
998 is even
1000 is even
```
